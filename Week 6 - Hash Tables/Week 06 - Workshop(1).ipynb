    "**Programming 5.2** If you've managed to complete the assignment and your report and don't have any questions about those, try implementing the two hash tables as above. This exercise is an opportunity to become a bit more familiar with function pointers. Function pointers aren't likely to come up in an exam, but do arise in some very generally written libraries, such as the qsort and bsearch stdlib implementations of quicksort and binary search (respectively). The right-left rule is a good trick for getting these definitions right, so you might find it useful to look that up if the definitions seem strange to you."

    "**Programming Challenge 5.1** Your friend in the police force has sent you an encrypted text file with evidence for an ongoing court case (the files were just ominously called \"CRIME1.txt\" and \"CRIME2.txt\"). Half of the data needs to be encrypted and the other half encrypted to find what the full message actually was. The police forensic unit also managed to find the encryption and decryption keys as well as the modulus (n).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this programming challenge, you will implement a simple 7-bit version of RSA, a very commonly used encryption algorithm. RSA works a lot like a hash function, though it is usually performed over much larger input spaces (typically in the region of 2048-bit numbers). Typically, RSA uses what is known as the square-and-multiply algorithm to do its encryption and decryption. This algorithm looks at each bit and performs either a square or multiply by 2. After each multiplication, you can mod the result by the modulus given.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the value x^10 which has binary representation 0b1010 the square and multiply algorithm would look something like this: \n",
    "1. We start with res = 1, in case we had x^0.\n",
    "2. We start with the highest order bit, which in this case is a 1, so we multiply by x, giving us x^1.\n",
    "3. Since there's another bit to look at, we square, which is equivalent to doing (x^(0b1))^2, giving us x^(0b10).\n",
    "4. Since the next bit is 0, we don't multiply by x.\n",
    "5. Since there's another bit to look at, we square, which is equivalent to doing (x^(0b10))^2, giving us x^(0b100).\n",
    "6. Since the next bit is 1, we multiply by x, giving us x^(0b100 + 0b1) = x^(0b101).\n",
    "7. Since there's another bit to look at, we square, giving us x^(0b1010).\n",
    "8. Since the next bit is 0, we don't multiply by x.\n",
    "9. Since there's not another bit to look at, we're done.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: This is the most intuitive way to explain the algorithm, but you might find doing the square before the possible multiply is more intuitive way to write the algorithm (since you don't have to check if there's another bit).\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be easiest to use the binary right-shift operator (>>) and the binary operator & (with 1) to work out how many bits there are to look through. Note also this algorithm is only correct for positive indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also: This works because the d, e and n chosen have specific properties to do with prime numbers and properties of modular arithmetic."
