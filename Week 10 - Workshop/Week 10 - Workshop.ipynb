    "**Programming 9.1** Given a set of data and key pairs, write a priority queue, this will be directly useful for next week's workshop. It should have a *makeQueue* function, which creates an empty priority queue, an *enqueue* function, which adds a data, key pair in the correct place in the queue, a *dequeue* function, which takes the highest priority item from the queue (for usefulness next week, you can make the highest priority the item with the *lowest* key), an *update* function, which moves an item with a certain index up in the queue to where it belongs (this function can assume the rest of the keys remain unchanged) and an *empty* function, which checks whether the queue is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: You don't need to make this task harder than it needs to be, you can implement this as an unsorted array. When a dequeue is called, you can search through all the items to find the cheapest item to dequeue and then remove it when a dequeue happens, replacing it with the last item in the array (so the items don't need to be shuffled). Likewise, in this case, the update function needn't do anything either. If you like, you can switch the underlying structure to a heap later and implement a lot of that more efficiently, but the input will be sufficiently small that this isn't much of a problem for the moment."

The map is given as a 2D array, where empty spaces are marked with ' &nbsp; ' and spaces you can't traverse are marked with '#', your starting location is marked with 'S' and the castle is marked with 'C'. Print out a path to the castle. This needn't be the shortest path, but you should ensure that the path doesn't return to the same location at any point (no moves are redundant). [2]"
