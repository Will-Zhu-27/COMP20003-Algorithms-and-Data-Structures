    "## Overview\n",
    "The workshop for week 11 will start with a tutorial on Graph representation, and you will implement your first Graph algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Questions\n",
    "**Question 10.1** In this question, you are asked to construct weighted graphs from records whose format is *vertex, vertex', weight*. For example, in a weighted, directed graph, the record 1,3,500 means that there is an edge from vertex 1 to vertex 3 with weight 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following questions all refer to the input data below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 2 200\n",
    "\n",
    "1 3 100\n",
    "\n",
    "1 4 500\n",
    "\n",
    "2 3 150\n",
    "\n",
    "2 4 300\n",
    "\n",
    "4 5 100\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Draw a weighted directed graph that reflects these edges and weights (logical representation).\n",
    "2. Construct an adjacency matrix for the weighted digraph you have just drawn, including the weights. Be explicit about how you are going to handle matrix cells for which there is no information in the data, and self-loops (edges between a node and itself).\n",
    "3. If you are told that these inputs refer to a weighted *undirected* graph, how could your adjacency matrix change.\n",
    "4. Which representation, adjacency matrix or adjacency list, would be most suitable for this graph?"

    "## Programming exercises\n",
    "**Programming 10.1** Given the weighted digraph G from the previous question where the edge weights represent distances between two vertices, use Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path from a selected vertex s to a target vertex t in G. You can use the priority queue from last week's workshop. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's a fair bit involved in making the priority queue do what you want it to in a proper way, so something just a little hackier will be fine (such as casting it to a particular exposed data type and pulling the bit from it you need or passing a function to apply to return an integer representing the priority of the item)."

    "**Programming Challenge 10.1** In this challenge question, you're involved in a city planning project which will be evaluating whether the estimated road capacity is likely to support the city goers who use them. A few simplifying assumptions have been made:\n",

    "- All citizens will only take the shortest paths from one of the three major residential districts,\n",
    "- All traffic occurs at the same time (that is, proper capacity is required at its worst),\n",
    "- Citizens only work at one of ten workplaces (all other traffic is marginal),\n",

    "- All roads are two-way and each road has separate, but equal, capacity in either direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question you need to be able to answer from your results is whether all roads along the shortest paths from residential districts to get to their workplaces support the populations that need to traverse them. Where multiple shortest paths are present which could split traffic isn't too important, so you needn't worry about trying to deal with that.\n",

    "1. Road capacity, the maximum population which can travel along the edge\n",

    "The data structure has otherwise remained mostly the same (though you are free to add additional properties if they make the task easier). An additional method *getAdjReference* gives you the actual list of weighted edges, this isn't necessarily the cleanest way to do it, but it should be fairly fast."
